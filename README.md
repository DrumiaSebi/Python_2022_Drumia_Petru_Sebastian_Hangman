The way it works it's straight forward, you try and guess a word and you can see the letter that you already guessed in their respective position from that word,
while having a limited number of tries. 
The game difficulty:
-> easy: you have the same ammount of tries as the lenght of the word
-> medium: you have half + 1 ammount of tries compared to the lenght of the word
-> hard: same ammount of tries as medium, but the words that are given to you are harder to guess( they are either very specific or represent scientific terms,
or are just words most people wouldn't think about).
The words are also grouped by categories, and you chose the category in the beginning.
Both the choise of game difficulty and category is done by simple menus(for Pycharm users, In order for both menus to work properly go to project(from run setting) -> Edit Configurations and in Execution section check Emulate terminal in output console.)
